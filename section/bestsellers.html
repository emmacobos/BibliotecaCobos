                            The book was 100% better than the film. A good book to sit down with on a horrible rain day! It makes you happy to be alive and happy to know that you are not going to be entered in a competition where you are to fight to your death every year. But it's a great story!</li>

                            I watched the movies and they were really good.Are the books better than the book? And if so should I read this trilogy?</li>

                            All three of the books are much, much, much better then the movies. The movies leave out many important parts whereas the book has a lot more depth and meaning etc in them so they are easier to understand the concept of the Hunger Games.</li>

                <div class="info__plot">This trilogy follows the life of Tris Prior, a young girl who is struggling to find her place in society. On their appointed day, every 16-year-old must pick the faction they stay with for the rest of their lives, or live factionless in contempt of society. For Tris Prior, her decision is incredibly difficult; be who she really is and join Dauntless or stay with her family and keep her feelings under lock and key. Tris chooses the Dauntless faction and a grueling initiation follows, in which her life is put at risk more than once. She is forced to fight, hurt and betray people she would never want to and friends she held dear perish. Whilst creating a new life for herself in the Dauntless faction, Tris must separate fake and real friends.</div>

                            I have to start by saying that watching the Divergent movie made me want to read the book. I really enjoyed the movie and I thought for sure there was more in the book. Movie goers didn’t miss as much as I had hoped.
