        <img class="mb-3 mt-3" src="../images/bestsellers.jpg" alt="Best Sellers">
        <div class="description mt-5">
            <p><strong>The New York Times bestseller list</strong></p>
            <p>This is considered the most important bestseller list, and the only one that people tend to talk about by name. If you make this list, you put "New York Times bestseller" on the top of your books. Every other list generally gets a "National bestseller" headline.</p>
            <div class="mb-5 mt-5">
                <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
                <p>The weekly bestsellers are calculated from Monday to Monday. Here is how they describe their methodology on their website -- "Rankings reflect sales reported by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles. The sales venues for print books include independent book retailers; national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university, gift and discount department stores; and newsstands. Ebook rankings reflect sales from leading online vendors of ebooks in a variety of popular ereader formats. Ebook sales are presently included for all adult categories (fiction, non-fiction and advice) except for graphic novels, and all children's categories with the exception of picture books. Titles are included regardless of whether they are published in both print and electronic formats or just one format. Ebooks available exclusively from a single vendor will be tracked at a future date."
                </p><p>
                As I mentioned before, the New York Times list is a survey list, not a tabulation of total sales. This means that they poll a curated selection of booksellers to estimate sales. They literally decide which bookstores and retail outlets are important and then only count those sales, ignoring all other sales. They also heavily weight independent bookstore sales. This is because they think that the type of people who shop at indie bookstores are more serious readers and thus their reading decisions deserve more attention. I'm serious, they have said this in public.
                </p><p>
                They also focus on individual sales, and try to not include bulk sales in their calculations. They do this to prevent people from buying their way onto the list. If you sell 1,000 copies to a company as part of a speaking engagement deal, this is a great way to move copies and make money, but it’s not very effective for hitting the list, because they won't count it.
                </p><p>
                And notice how they say that won't count ebook sales from only one source? This is a direct shot at Amazon. They don't like Amazon, and they don't think ebooks are real books. They don't want to see their ebook list dominated by Amazon's Kindle list.
                </p><p>
                Make no mistake about it -- this is all just as elitist and snobbish as it sounds. They only recently started including ebooks in their lists, and they still heavily discount ebooks that have no print edition. Yes they track them, but they count their sales as less.
                </p><p>
                The reality is that even though the New York Times list is seen as the most prestigious, in many ways it's the least connected to actual book selling reality.</p>

                <p><strong>Tips and tricks</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the most part, they do not count self-published books. You must work through a traditional publishing company to even have a shot at this list.</li>
                    <li>The category and window of your release significantly impacts the number of copies required to hit the New York Times bestseller list, but 5,000 copies during any one-week period is the minimum. I would recommend 10,000 to be sure.</li>
                    <li>Have your publisher pick a down time in publishing. The fewer big books you have to compete with, the better.</li>

                            The book was 100% better than the film. A good book to sit down with on a horrible rain day! It makes you happy to be alive and happy to know that you are not going to be entered in a competition where you are to fight to your death every year. But it's a great story!</li>

                            All three of the books are much, much, much better then the movies. The movies leave out many important parts whereas the book has a lot more depth and meaning etc in them so they are easier to understand the concept of the Hunger Games.</li>
